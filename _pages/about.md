Hello! I am a second-year PhD student at UC San Diego, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Qipeng Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/qipengliu/), and be part of the [UCSD Theory Group](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/). Before that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Yao Class, Tsinghua University.

My research focuses on the intersection of quantum information and cryptography, while I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and quantum information theory. Currently, I am particularly interested in understanding random unitaries and random functions through oracle purification techniques, such as compressed oracles and path recording methods.

Outside research, I like photographing, hiking, skateboarding, and I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli's movie :)
